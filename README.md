Non ASCII
=========

Command-line Ruby script for detecting non-ASCII characters in files.
Only lines with detected non-ASCII characters are displayed. Detected characters are replaced with `ï¿½.`
Inspired by:

```shell
grep --color='auto' -P -n "[\x80-\xFF]" file.xml
```

Usage
-----

Files (one or more) are passed as arguments to the script:

```shell
non_ascii test.txt
```
